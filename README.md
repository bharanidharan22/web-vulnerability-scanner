## Description

The **Web Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of identifying common web security vulnerabilities. This tool is particularly useful for security professionals, developers, and testers who want to ensure that their web applications are secure against prevalent threats.

### Key Features

1. **SQL Injection Testing**: 
   - The scanner detects potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities by injecting commonly used SQL payloads into web forms. SQL Injection is a critical security flaw that can allow attackers to manipulate or access your database.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing**: 
   - It tests for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting script payloads into web forms. XSS vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of users or the theft of sensitive information.

3. **HTTP Header Check**: 
   - The tool checks for the presence of important HTTP security headers that enhance web application security. Missing headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` can expose web applications to various attacks.

4. **PDF Report Generation**: 
   - After scanning, the tool generates a detailed PDF report that summarizes the vulnerabilities found during the scan. This report includes information on SQL Injection issues, XSS vulnerabilities, and any missing HTTP security headers, making it easy to review and address security concerns.

### Purpose

The Web Vulnerability Scanner aims to help web developers and security professionals automate the identification of common vulnerabilities in web applications. By running this tool, users can proactively discover and fix security issues before they are exploited by malicious actors.

### How It Works

1. **Crawling**: 
   - The tool crawls the specified URL to discover all web forms present on the page.

2. **Testing**:
   - It performs SQL Injection and XSS testing on the discovered forms using predefined payloads.
   - It also checks the HTTP headers of the response to ensure essential security headers are present.

3. **Reporting**:
   - The results of the scan are compiled into a PDF report, which provides a detailed summary of detected vulnerabilities and missing security headers.

### Usage

This tool is easy to use and requires minimal setup. Simply configure the target URL, run the script, and review the generated PDF report to understand the vulnerabilities in your web application.
